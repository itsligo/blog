### Blog MVC Application

App to work with Blogs & Posts.

The Index action method of the Home Controller displays the list of Blogs. Clicking on each Blog displays details about that Blog (e.g. Title and Author).

Concepts examined:
* Role of Controller as 'director of operations' - routing.
* Preparation of **Views** either directly or through scaffolding
* Initial minor role of **Models** folder for **Blog** and **Post**
* Introduction of **ViewModels** folder to represent custom views of data in **Models**
* Preparation of data (artificially) in Controller for publishing through Views.
