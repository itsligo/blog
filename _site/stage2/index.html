Home page depicts a list of Blogs with some complementary data - e.g. number of posts presented in a CSS-enhanced layout. Clicking a Blog (either the row depicting the blog or via a button) leads to a View for each Blog revealing more details of the Blog such as a list of Postss for that Blog. Links going in the reverse direction should also be coded. Again Bootstrap is used to improve presentation of this data.
Models are improved to provide an Author class with some attributes such as Name &amp; Address (city will suffice).
Concepts covered:
* Data Annotations - to decorate fields for inclusion in Views
* Basic querying of POCO to populate ViewModels
* Bootstrap enhanced Views
* Some UI enhancements via jQuery/Bootstrap - perhaps integrated Google Map for Author city.
